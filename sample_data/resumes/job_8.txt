Key Responsibilities

Structural Analysis and Design

Perform structural analysis and design of steel structures using advanced software tools (e.g., STAAD.Pro, SAP2000, ETABS, Tekla Structural Designer).
Ensure designs comply with applicable codes and standards (e.g., AISC, Eurocode, BS, ASCE, IBC).
Drawing and Detailing

Produce detailed design drawings, connection designs, and fabrication-ready shop drawings using AutoCAD, Revit, or Tekla Structures.
Coordinate with draftsmen and BIM modelers for accurate 2D/3D outputs.
Project Development

Participate in the development of structural schemes and preliminary layouts during the conceptual and design stages.
Collaborate with architects, civil engineers, mechanical engineers, and contractors to ensure integrated project delivery.
Technical Documentation

Prepare comprehensive design reports, specifications, material take-offs, and calculation packages.
Conduct design reviews, value engineering assessments, and constructability evaluations.
Site and Client Interface

Provide technical support during project execution phases including fabrication, construction, and site erection.
Liaise with clients to understand project requirements and present design solutions effectively
Required Skills and Qualifications

Bachelor’s Degree in Civil or Structural Engineering (Master’s Degree preferred).
Professional Engineer (PE) or equivalent registration is a strong advantage.
Minimum 5 years of experience in the design of steel structures.
Proficiency in design and analysis software such as:
STAAD.Pro, ETABS, SAP2000, Tekla Structural Designer
Tekla Structures / SDS/2 (for steel detailing)
AutoCAD, Revit (for general drafting and modeling)
Strong knowledge of steel behavior, load combinations, structural dynamics, and fatigue analysis.
Familiarity with wind, seismic, and other dynamic load design principles.
Excellent understanding of welding, bolting, and fabrication practices.
Strong project management, communication, and technical writing skills.
